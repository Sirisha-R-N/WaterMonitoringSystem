# IoT-Based Smart Water Management: Water Level & Consumption Monitoring for Homes

This project implements a smart water management system for homes, enabling real-time water level and consumption monitoring using IoT technologies. The solution leverages sensors and cloud connectivity to track water usage and storage, providing actionable insights for efficient water management.

## Project Requirements

To set up and run the IoT-based Smart Water Management system, you will need the following hardware and software components:

### Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi 4B**  
  Acts as the main controller and data processing unit for the system.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**  
  Used to measure the water level in the storage tank.
- **Water Flow Sensor**  
  Monitors the rate of water consumption.
- **Resistors**  
  Required for interfacing sensors and ensuring appropriate voltage levels.

### Software & Cloud Requirements

- **Python**  
  Primary programming language for developing scripts to collect sensor data, process information, and manage communications.
- **ThingSpeak Cloud Platform**  
  Used for IoT data storage, visualization, and remote monitoring of water level and consumption statistics.
- **MATLAB**  
  Utilized for advanced data analysis, processing, and visualization on the ThingSpeak platform.
